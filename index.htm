            <p>Albert Einstein (14 March 1879â€“18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist,[7] widely
                acknowledged
                to
                be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for
                developing
                the
                theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of
                quantum
                mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two pillars of modern physics.</p>

                <h1>Know Your Global Community</h1>
                <p>A community is a social unit (a group of living things) with commonality such as place, norms,
                    religion,
                    values, customs, or identity. Communities may share a sense of place situated in a given
                    geographical
                    area (e.g. a country, village, town, or neighbourhood) or in virtual space through communication
                    platforms. Durable relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties also define a sense of
                    community, important to their identity, practice, and roles in social institutions such as family,
                    home,
                    work, government, society, or humanity at large.</p>
